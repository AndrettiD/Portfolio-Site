                 <p>
                    My name is Andretti and Iâ€™m a sound designer turned software engineer <br> 
                    with a passion for integrating my audio knowledge with unique technology<br>
                    and code. I have a profound interest in technology and how it has changed <br>
                    in the last few years. I want to be part of that change and create tools <br>
                    and applications that can make a difference in the world.
                 </p>
                  <p>
                    Through my love for learning, I have pushed myself to acquire a variety <br> 
                    of skills such as Coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, React, Ruby, MongoDB, Mongoose, SQL, ) <br>
                    and designing sound for live theater.
                    
                    I chose to become a Software Engineer because <br> 
                    I am always interested <br>
                    in how things work from the inside out. Through six months of self-study <br>
                    followed by the Software Engineering Immersive with General Assembly, <br> 
                    I learned how to code in a variety of languages while connecting with <br> 
                    new colleagues from all over the country. I enjoy how software engineering <br> 
                    requires me to work closely with a team to complete satisfying projects.
